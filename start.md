With LiaScript, we tried to implement an extended
[Markdown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown) format that should enable
everyone to create, share, adapt, translate or correct online courses without
the need of being a web-developer. We believe that a language-based approach,
instead of a tooling-centered one, provides more flexibility, freedom of
creativity, and sustainability. Therefor we tried to develop a simplistic syntax
that extends the static Markdown with quizzes, animations, spoken text,
automated visualization [ASCII-art](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASCII_art) and
much more. Everything has been woven around Markdown, so that the content can
still be read and interpreted with any kind of editor or Markdown-interpreter.
